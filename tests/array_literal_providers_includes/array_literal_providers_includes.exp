Error --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- include.js:5:8

Cannot call `x.push` because string [1] is incompatible with number [2] in array element. All writes to `x` must be
compatible with the type of its initial element [2]. Add an annotation to `x` [3] if a different type is desired.
